###### CS-207-3: Programming II <br> Spring 2021 <br> Northeastern Illinois University <br> Homework #3 <br> Due Date: 02/03/21 at 9:00 p.m. (CT) <br> Strings, Part II

**Getting Started**

**1.** Detailed instructions are located in the tutorial videos.<br>
**2.** Accept the assignment invitation on D2L.<br>
**3.** Clone the assignment to your computer.<br>
**4.** Go to File > Project Structure. Under Project Settings, click on Project and verify that the Project SDK is set
to JDK 11 or higher.  If it is not, select the correct SDK from the drop-down.<br>
**5.** Go to File > Settings (Mac: IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences). Under Build, Execution, Deployment and under Build
Tools, click Gradle. Make sure Build and run using: and Run tests using: are set to Gradle. Make sure Use Gradle from:
is set to 'gradle-wrapper.properties' file. And make sure Gradle JVM is set to JDK 11 or higher.<br>
**6.** Project SDK and Gradle JVM should be set to the same Java version.<br>
**7.** Create the main/java directory in the src directory. This is where you will be creating your Java classes for
your assignment. Right click src and go to New > Directory and select main/java.<br>

**Submitting your assignment**

**1.** Once you have completed all the problems, commit your final code to GitHub. <br>
- Please also commit code after each step of each problem and remember to run the unit tests (where applicable) and
  code analyzers before you commit.

**2.** Then in IntelliJ, go to File, select Export to Zip File. This will create a zip file of the entire project directory.<br>
**3.** Submit the .zip file to the Homework 3 Assignment folder on D2L.<br>

### Problem 1

**1.** In the main/java directory, create a class named `MyString`. It should include the following:
- A private (i.e. encapsulated) String instance variable named `original`.
- A constructor that takes one String parameter and sets the instance variable.
- A getter for the instance variable.
  - Uncomment the test named `shouldInitializeInstanceVariable` in the `MyStringTest` class (in the `test/java`
    directory). Run the test. Run the code analyzers and commit your code now.
- A method named `removeVowels` that does not take any parameters and returns a String. This method should
  remove the vowels (a/A, e/E, i/I, o/O, u/U) from `original` and return a String composed of just the consonants
  with their order preserved. **You may not use any loops.**
  - Uncomment the tests beginning with `removeVowels...` in the `MyStringTest` class (in the `test/java` directory).
    Run the tests. Run the code analyzers and commit your code now.
- A method named `removeNonVowels` that does not take any parameters and returns a String. This method should remove
  everything that is not a vowel (not a/A, e/E, i/I, o/O, u/U) from `original` and return a String composed of just
  the vowels with their order preserved. **You may not use any loops.**
  - Uncomment the tests beginning with `removeNonVowels...` in the `MyStringTest` class (in the `test/java` directory).
    Run the tests. Run the code analyzers and commit your code now.

**Note.** To help you debug and understand your code, you can create a `MyStringDemo` class with the `main` method,
but it is not required as part of your grade.<br>
<br>

### Problem 2

**1.** In the main/java directory, create a class named `DateConversion`. It should include the following:
- A private (i.e. encapsulated) String instance variable named `date`. Note that this variable will be in the form:<br>
  Day Month Year, where:<br>
  Day is in the set {"1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th", ..., "30th", "31st"}<br>
  Month is in the set {"Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"}<br>
  Year is in the range [1900, 2100]<br>
- A constructor that takes one String parameter and sets the `date` instance variable.
- A getter for the `date` instance variable.
  - Uncomment the test named `shouldInitializeInstanceVariable` in the `DateConversionTest` class (in the `test/java`
    directory). Run the test. Run the code analyzers and commit your code now.
- A method named `reformatDate` that does not take any parameters and returns a String. This method should return a String
  that represents the date in the form YYYY-Month-DD. For example, if `date` is Oct 23rd 2010, the method should return
  2010-Oct-23. **You may not use any loops and or any conditional blocks (if/if-else/switch/ternary) in your code.**
  - Uncomment the tests in `DateConversionTest` beginning with `reformatDate...` in the `DateConversionTest` class (in
    the `test/java` directory). Run the tests. Run the code analyzers and commit your code now.

**Note.** To help you debug and understand your code, you can create a `StringConversionDemo` class with the main method, but it
is not required as part of your grade.<br>
<br>

### Problem 3

**1.** In the main/java directory, create a class named `StringChecks` that has the following:
- A private default constructor that is empty.
- A static method name `sameSides` that takes a String parameter and returns a boolean. You can assume that the String
  has an even (i.e. evenly divisible by 2) number of characters. The method should divide the parameter in half and
  return true if the first half has the same number of vowels as the second half. **You may not use any loops.**
  - Uncomment the tests beginning with `sameSides...` in the `StringChecksTest` class (in the `test/java`
    directory). Run the tests. Run the code analyzers and commit your code now.
- A static method named `anagram` that takes two String parameters and returns a boolean. The method should
  return true if the two String parameters are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words that have the exact
  same characters but in a different order. For example, cat and tac are anagrams, but catt and taac are not anagrams.
  You can assume that the parameters contain lowercase letters. **You may use at most one loop in
  your code - no nested loops.**
  - Uncomment the tests beginning with `anagram...` in the `StringChecksTest` class (in the `test/java`
    directory). Run the tests. Run the code analyzers and commit your code now.
